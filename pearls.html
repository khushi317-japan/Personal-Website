        <p>People all over the world have long admired pearls as jewelry and accessories that complement global fashions. According to historical records, pearls have been used as jewelry since ancient Rome and Persia. In Japan, they were referred to as “white gems” and were offered to the gods.</p>
        <p>Pearls are significant to me because it’s my family’s business. The variety of price-making characteristics and their role in determining demand make this a fascinating industry to study. Pearl distributors act as intermediaries in the market — neither the producers (harvesters) nor the final consumers — so it’s interesting to understand how they analyze both sides when deciding which goods to purchase. Although firms may specialize in certain types of pearls, there are many additional determinants they consider when buying. How consumers then respond to those choices can create information asymmetry between buyer and seller.</p>
        <p>Pearls are valued for several qualities: size, color, shape, luster, surface quality, nacre thickness, and how well they match one another in finished jewelry. Necklaces are the most popular pearl jewelry. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) provides guidance on how these features affect value:</p>

      <h2>Types of Pearls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Akoya Pearls:</strong> Classic Japanese saltwater pearls known for their high luster and perfectly round shape.</li>
        <li><strong>South Sea Pearls:</strong> Cultivated mainly in Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines; the largest and rarest variety with a soft satiny glow.</li>
        <li><strong>Tahitian Pearls:</strong> Naturally dark pearls from French Polynesia, famous for their black, green, and gray hues.</li>
        <li><strong>Freshwater Pearls:</strong> Grown in rivers and lakes, usually more affordable and available in various shapes and colors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Pearls Are Valued (GIA)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger pearls are generally more valuable.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Round is the rarest and highly valued; well-formed baroque, pear, and oval shapes are also popular.</li>
        <li><strong>Luster:</strong> The most important factor — the reflectivity and sharpness of the surface that create a pearl’s glow.</li>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Traditional colors include black and white, while unusual tones like brown and blue are increasingly popular.</li>
        <li><strong>Nacre thickness:</strong> Thicker nacre improves durability and beauty; dull or chalky pearls often have thin nacre.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface quality:</strong> Blemishes and irregularities affect durability and desirability.</li>
        <li><strong>Matching ability:</strong> In multi-pearl pieces, how well pearls match in size, color, and luster increases value.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Given the vast shapes and colors designers are finding inspiration in contrasting and intermixing pearls to create totally new expressions. That is the critical thing with regards to pearls, making them relevant and everyday wearable</p>
